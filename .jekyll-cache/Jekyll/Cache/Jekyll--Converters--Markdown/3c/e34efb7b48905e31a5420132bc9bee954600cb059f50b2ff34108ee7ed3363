<h2 id="general-idea">General Idea</h2>

<p>The March Conference aims to foster an interest in programming in general, and we do this by introducing participants to 
various programming languages, such as Python and JavaScript, and also some Markup Formats (notably HTML/CSS).</p>

<p>The introductory concepts introduced in these workshops function as a â€œfirst-stepâ€ for BuildingBloCS before we move on to 
bigger and higher-level events.</p>

<p>Capping off the March Conference will be a contest, but one that might catch some off guard. Unlike the classic Hackathon 
adopted in the June Conference, we will instead be taking inspiration from <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>
and <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> by organising our very own â€œHackathonâ€ for open-source,
namely â€œâ€</p>
