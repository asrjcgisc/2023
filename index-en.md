This year, our conference is divided into three **different** events, focused on **different** themes altogether. These are the June, March and FOSSASIA Conferences!

## The June Conference
Our flagship event of the year, the June Conference will be held in around the first week of June, with a central theme: **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. We're hosting over 17 workshops, 5 talks and 3 hackathons for programmers of various skill levels from beginner to advanced, and we're also proud to partner with Meta, CYS and AISG! <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/events/june-conference">Learn more</a> and <a href="https://go.buildingblocs.sg/june">sign up</a> now!

## The March Conference
The March Conference aims to foster an interest in programming in general. We did this in March 2023 by introducing participants to various programming languages, such as Python and JavaScript, and also hosting our own Python-based beginner gamified competition!
